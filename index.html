   <h2> Showing Climate Change with a zoetrope</h2>
   <p> For this project, my group and I built a zoetrope out of cardboard; and used legos as the pieces that go on the base that shows an interpretation of climate change. </p>

<p> The idea is to have the legos represent us humans. Them holding the globe as it slowly worsens represent how the world is in our hands and were just ruining it. </p>
